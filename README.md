# Gradient-Generator
Tool for making color gradients

### How to install:
> Download the zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing.
> The .NET library required to run should already be included with windows.  If not, download and install the .NET library directly from Microsoft.
> Run Gradient Generator.exe

### How to use:
> Click on the color wheel to rough in a color.
> Use the slider bars to fine tune the color and optionally change the alpha, or transparency.
> Click 'Add Color' to add the selected color to the list.  A gradient will be automatically generated when two or more colors have been choosen.
> Multiple colors can be selected by holding Ctrl or Shift while clicking on colors.  Selected colors can be shifted up or down, removed, or duplicated.
> Duplicated colors will appear at the end of the list.
> The type of gradient can be changed via the drop down list.

When you are satisfied with the gradient, make sure the width and height are set to the size you want and click 'Save Gradient'.  If 'Also Save List' is checked, a .color file will be saved with the same name.  This can be loaded for quick setup of previously generated gradients.
